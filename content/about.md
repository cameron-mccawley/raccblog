Hi! Welcome to my dumpster.

I've been in `security operations` for three years now, though my interests primarily lie in `cybercrime intelligence` and `detection engineering`. I've been fortunate enough to gain a ton of hands-on experience in cybersecurity through OSUSEC, a nationally recognized security club at Oregon State University, where I served as president. The skills I gained from leading and competing at OSUSEC enabled me to secure an internship at `Mandiant` (part of Google Cloud) as a `technical intelligence analyst`, which is what sparked my love in researching cybercrime.

I graduated from OSU in 2023 with a BS in `computer science` with focus in cybersecurity, and a minor in `mathematics` with a focus on number theory and cryptography. Now, I work as a `lead security analyst` for OSU, finding innovative ways to use our Microsoft XDR and Sentinel platforms to respond to incidents, write detections + automation rules, mentor students, and improve the security posture of the university.

Outside of cybersecurity, I am a fairly proficient `drummer`. I play a wide range of genres with a wide variety of people, though I have a soft spot for anything that's heavy and loud. Some of my biggest influences currently are Mastodon, KGATLW, Acid Bath, Tool, Opeth, System of a Down, Foo Fighters, and Gojira. I also enjoy watching `movies`, especially independent or low budget flicks, and I'm always in search of a new "so bad it's good" gem.

Feel free to reach out, and/or send me cool raccoon pics :3
